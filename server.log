[1] 3. Evaluate consistency across related answers
[1] 4. Factor in industry context and business size
[1] 5. Consider regulatory and compliance risks

[1] - Operational efficiency and scalability
[1] - Regulatory compliance and legal risks
[1] - Management quality and succession planning
[1] - Customer concentration and supplier dependencies
[1] - Technology and competitive advantages
[1] - Geographic and economic factors
[1] 
[1] Always provide a numerical score between 0 and 100, where higher scores indicate lower risk.
[1]
