"""
Test to verify that infinite loop is prevented when typing in "Other" text field.

This test validates the fix for the issue where:
- User selects "Other" option in a question
- User types text in the "Other" text field
- System was sending API requests in an infinite loop

The fix includes:
1. Tracking evaluation in progress to prevent duplicate calls
2. Tracking last evaluated answers to avoid re-evaluating unchanged answers
3. Debouncing onBlur events for "Other" text fields
