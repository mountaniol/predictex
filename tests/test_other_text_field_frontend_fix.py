Test for frontend "Other" text field fix in multi-choice questions.

This test verifies that the AnswerInput.js component correctly handles:
1. Rendering "Other" text field when "other" option is selected
2. Saving text field values and triggering re-evaluation
3. Auto-submission when text field loses focus (onBlur)

Problem Fixed:
- AnswerInput.js choice-multi section was missing support for with_other + other_text_id
- Users could select "Other" but couldn't enter text, causing generic AI responses
- No automatic re-evaluation when "Other" text content changed

Solution Implemented:
- Added support for with_other and other_text_id in choice-multi questions
- Text field appears when "other" option is selected
- onBlur events trigger automatic re-evaluation
- Consistent behavior across all question types
