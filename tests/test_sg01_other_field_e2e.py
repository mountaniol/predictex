End-to-end test for SG01 "Other" text field bug fix using browser automation.

This test validates that the "Other" text field bug has been fixed by:
1. Opening the web interface in a real browser
2. Navigating to SG01 question
3. Selecting "Other" option and filling in text
4. Triggering AI evaluation
5. Verifying AI receives the full text content instead of just "Other"

Bug: When user selects "Other" and fills text field, AI was receiving generic "Other"
Fix: AI now receives "Other: [actual user text content]"
